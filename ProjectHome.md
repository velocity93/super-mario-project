Super Mario project is a 2D platform game, inspired by 16-bits platformers, such as Super Mario World. It aims to recreate the gameplay of SMW, with better graphics, and to provide tools to make new levels and enemis.
This project should be able to run on Windows, Linux, and MacOS systems, as it uses only pure C++, OpenGL, SFML and LibXML2.
